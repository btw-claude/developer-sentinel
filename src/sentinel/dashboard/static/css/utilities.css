/**
 * CSS Utility Classes
 *
 * This file contains reusable utility classes for the Developer Sentinel dashboard.
 * These are extracted from base.html for better organization and maintainability.
 *
 * Note: These classes depend on CSS custom properties defined in base.html:
 * - --text-secondary: Secondary text color (typically #aaa)
 *
 * Usage:
 * - Apply these classes directly to HTML elements for quick styling
 * - Prefer utility classes over inline styles for consistency
 *
 * Related: DS-154 (original implementation), DS-159 (extraction to this file)
