  Macro to render a badge with automatic state-based styling.

  - badge--inactive: When active_count is 0 (nothing active)
  - badge--success: When active_count equals total_count (all active)
  - (default): When partially active (some but not all)

  @param active_count - Number of currently active items
  @param total_count - Total number of items
  @returns The badge element with appropriate styling class
#}
{% macro status_badge(active_count, total_count) %}
<span class="badge{% if active_count == 0 %} badge--inactive{% elif active_count == total_count %} badge--success{% endif %}">{{ active_count }}/{{ total_count }}</span>
{%- endmacro %}
