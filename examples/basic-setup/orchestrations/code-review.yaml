# Basic Code Review Orchestration
#
# This is a minimal example that:
# 1. Watches for issues tagged with "needs-code-review"
# 2. Sends them to a Claude agent for review
# 3. Posts feedback as a Jira comment
# 4. Tags the issue as "code-reviewed" when complete
#
# Customize the project key and prompts for your use case.

orchestrations:
  - name: "code-review"

    # Trigger: Which issues activate this workflow
    #
    # Available fields for Jira triggers:
    #   - project: Jira project key (validated for safe characters)
    #   - tags: List of labels the issue must have (all required, sanitized)
    #   - jql_filter: Custom JQL fragment for advanced filtering (see Security Note)
    #
    # Security Note for jql_filter:
    #   The jql_filter field accepts raw JQL and should only be configured by
    #   trusted administrators. Basic validation is performed (balanced quotes
    #   and parentheses, no null bytes, length limits), but the content is
    #   passed to the Jira API. Example usage:
    #     jql_filter: 'priority = "High" AND type = "Bug"'
    #
    trigger:
      source: jira
      project: "DEMO"           # Change to your Jira project key
      tags:
        - "needs-code-review"   # Issues with this label trigger processing

        You are a code review assistant. Review the following Jira issue.

        ## Issue Details
        **Key:** {jira_issue_key}
        **Summary:** {jira_summary}
        **Status:** {jira_status}
        **Assignee:** {jira_assignee}

        **Description:**
        {jira_description}

        ## Your Task
        1. Analyze the issue description for code-related concerns
        2. If there are linked pull requests, review them
        3. Post a helpful comment on the Jira issue with your findings
        4. Focus on:
           - Code correctness and potential bugs
           - Security considerations
           - Performance implications
           - Best practices

        End your response with SUCCESS if the review was completed,
        or FAILURE if you encountered blocking issues.

    # Retry: How to handle failures
    retry:
      max_attempts: 3
      success_patterns:
        - "SUCCESS"
      failure_patterns:
        - "FAILURE"
        - "ERROR:"

    # Tag management: Prevent duplicate processing
    on_start:
      add_tag: "sentinel-processing"

    # What to do on success
    on_complete:
      add_tag: "code-reviewed"

    # What to do when all retries fail
    on_failure:
      add_tag: "review-failed"
