  # Import sorting with isort
  # Configuration is read from pyproject.toml [tool.isort] section
  # Note: ruff.lint.select includes "I" (isort rules) for IDE integration,
  # while this dedicated isort hook handles pre-commit enforcement.
  # Both use the same pyproject.toml configuration for consistency.
